- CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing), Private vs Public IP
  - method for allocationg IP adresses
- Default VPC
  	- all new accounts have a default VPC
- VPC - IPv4
  -	can have multiple VPCs in an AWS region (MAX 5 per region - soft limit)
  -	MAX CIDR per VPC is 5, for each CIDR
    - Min size is /28 (16 Ip Addresses)
    - Max size is /16 (65536 IP addresses)
	- Because VPS is private, Only the Private IPv4 ranges are allowed
- VPC - Subnet(IPv4)
  - AES reserves 5 IP addresses (first 4 and last 1) in each subnet
  - These IP addresses are not available for use and can't be assigned to an EC2 instance
  - Example: if CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24, then reserved IP addresses are
    - 10.0.0.0 - Network Address
    - 10.0.0.1 - reserved for VPC router
    - 10.0.0.2 - for mapping to Amazon-provided DNS
    - 10.0.0.3 - for future user
    - 10.0.0.255 - Network broadcast address, AWS does not support broadcast in a VPC, therfore the address is reserved
- Internet Gateway (IGW)
  	- Allow resources in a vpc to connect Internet
