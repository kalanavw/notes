- CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing), Private vs Public IP
  - method for allocationg IP adresses
- Default VPC
  	- all new accounts have a default VPC
- VPC - IPv4
  - can have multiple VPCs in an AWS region (MAX 5 per region - soft limit)
  - MAX CIDR per VPC is 5, for each CIDR
  - Min size is /28 (16 Ip Addresses)
  - Max size is /16 (65536 IP addresses)
	- Because VPS is private, Only the Private IPv4 ranges are allowed
- VPC - Subnet(IPv4)
  - AES reserves 5 IP addresses (first 4 and last 1) in each subnet
  - These IP addresses are not available for use and can't be assigned to an EC2 instance
  - Example: if CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24, then reserved IP addresses are
    - 10.0.0.0 - Network Address
    - 10.0.0.1 - reserved for VPC router
    - 10.0.0.2 - for mapping to Amazon-provided DNS
    - 10.0.0.3 - for future user
    - 10.0.0.255 - Network broadcast address, AWS does not support broadcast in a VPC, therfore the address is reserved
- Internet Gateway (IGW)
	- Allow resources in a vpc to connect Internet
	- Scaled horizontally and has HA
	- One  VOC can only be attached to one IGW and wise versa
	- Route tables must be edited
- Bastion Host
  - use to SSh into our private EC2 instances
  - Bation Host security group must allow inbound from the internet on port 22 from restricted CIDR, Ex - public CIDR of your corporation
  - Security Group of the EC2 instances must alllow the Security Group of the Bastion Host
- NAT instance - Network Address Translation
  - Allow EC2 instances in private subnets to connect to the internet
  - Must be launched in public subnet
  - Must disable EC2 settings: Source/ destination Check
  - Must have Elastic IP attached to it
  - Route table must be configured to route traffic from private subnets to the NAT instance
  - for ping command, we need to enable icmp port
- NAT Gateway
  - AWS managed NAT, HA
  - Can't be used by EC2 instance in the same subnet (only from the other subnets)
  - Requires an IGW (Private Subnet => NATGW => IGW)
  - 5 Gbps of bandwidth with automated scaling up to 100Gbps
  - Is resilient withiin a single AZ
  - Must create multiple NAT in multiple AZ
- NACL (Network ACL) & Security Groups
  - NACL - stateless & SG - stateful
  - NACL are like a firewall which control traffic drom and to subnets
  - One NACL or subnet, subnets are assigned the Default NACL
  - NACL rule have a number, first rule match will drive the decision
  - Newly creted NACLs will deny everything
  - NACLs are great way of blocking a specific IP address at the subnet level
  - Ephemeral Ports
    - For any two endpoints to establish a connection, they must use ports
- VPC Peering
  - privetly connect two VPCs using AWS network
  - Make them behave as if they were in the same network
  - Must not have overlapping CIDRs
- VPC Endpoints
  - to connect other AWS services without connecting through internet
  - every AWS service is publicly exposed
  - VPC Endpoints(Powered by AWS PrivateLink) allows you to connect to AWS service using a private network instead a using the public internet
  - redundant and scale horizontally
  - Types of endpoints
    - interface  - powered by privatelink
    - Gateway Endpoint - free
      -supports both s3 and DynamoDB
